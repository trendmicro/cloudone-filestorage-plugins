    - Install the AWS command line interface (CLI). See [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) for details.
    - Install the Terraform CLI. See [Install Terraform CLI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli#install-terraform) for download information.
2. **Configure Slack Webhook App**
    - Create a Slack Channel to receive the notification
    - Go to App Directory > Search `Incoming WebHooks`.
    - Click on `Incoming WebHooks`, then click "Add to Slack"
    - Choose the Channel to receive the notification
    - Copy Webhook URL
    - Enter the Description of your WebHook.

3. Ensure that you have the terraform and AWS CLIs installed and configured, then go to terraform folder and change appropriately the values at the variables in the `variables.tf` file or use the example `slack.tfvars`.

    Run the following script:

    ```terraform
        terraform init
        terraform plan
        terraform apply
    ```

    If you decided to use the `slack.tfvars` file, replace the `terraform apply` command above to `terraform apply -var-file="slack.tfvars`

## Clean-up

To revert or destroy the created resources, run the following script:

```terraform
terraform destroy
```

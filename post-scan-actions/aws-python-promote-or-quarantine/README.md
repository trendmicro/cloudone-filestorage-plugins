# Post Scan Action - Promote or Quarantine

After a scan occurs, this example Lambda function places clean files in one bucket and malicious files in another.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install supporting tools**
    - Install the AWS command line interface (CLI). See [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) for details.
    - Install GNU Make if you don't want to use the AWS CLI. See [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for download information.
2. **Create two S3 buckets**
    - Create a 'Promote bucket' to receive clean files. Example: `fss-promote`.
    - Create a 'Quarantine bucket' to receive quarantined files. Example: `fss-quarantine`.
3. **Create a custom policy**

    <details>
    <summary>Using the AWS console</summary>
    
    1. Go to **Services > IAM**.
    2. On the left, click **Policies**.
    3. In the main pane, click **Create policy**.
    4. Click the **JSON** tab.
    5. Paste the [JSON code below](#JSON) into the text box, making sure to replace the variables in the JSON code with your own values. Variables are described following the code.
    6. Click **Review policy**.
    7. On the **Review policy** page:
        - In the **Name** field, enter a name. Example: `FSS_Lambda_Policy`.

    <details>
    <summary>Using the AWS CLI</summary>

    1. Paste the [JSON code below](#JSON) into a file called `fss-trust-policy.json` (or another name) making sure to replace the variables in the JSON code with your own values. Variables are described following the code. 
    2. In a shell program such as bash or Windows Powershell, enter the following AWS CLI command to create the policy:

        `aws iam create-policy --policy-name <YOUR_FSS_LAMBDA_POLICY> --policy-document file://fss-trust-policy.json`

        where `<YOUR_FSS_LAMBDA_POLICY>` is replaced with the name you want to give to the custom policy. Example: `FSS_Lambda_Policy`.
    3. In the output, take note of the custom policy's ARN. Example: `arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:policy/FSS_Lambda_Policy`

## Subscribe the Lambda to the SNS topic

1. **Find the 'ScanResultTopic' SNS topic ARN** 
    - In the AWS console, go to **Services > CloudFormation** > your all-in-one stack > **Resources** > your storage stack > **Resources**.
    - Scroll down to locate the  **ScanResultTopic** Logical ID. 
    - Copy the **ScanResultTopic** ARN to a temporary location. Example: `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123445678901:FileStorageSecurity-All-In-One-Stack-StorageStack-1IDPU1PZ2W5RN-ScanResultTopic-N8DD2JH1GRKF`
2. **Find the Lambda function ARN**
    
    📌 The Lamdba function ARN is only required if you plan to use the AWS CLI (as opposed to the console) to subscribe the Lambda to the SNS topic.
    - In the AWS console, go to **Services > Lambda**.
    - Search for the Lambda function you created previously. Example: `FSS_Prom_Quar_Lambda`
    - Click the Lambda function link.
    - On the top-left, locate the **ARN**.
    - Copy the ARN to a temporary location. Example: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123445678901:function:FSS_Prom_Quar_Lambda`
3. **Subscribe the Lambda to the SNS topic**

    <details>
    <summary>Using the AWS console</summary>

    1. Go to **Services > Lambda**.
    2. Search for the Lambda function you created previously. Example: `FSS_Prom_Quar_Lambda`
    3. Click the link to your Lambda function to view its details.
    4. Click **Add trigger** on the left.
    5. From the **Trigger configuration** list, select **SNS**.
    6. In the **SNS topic** field, enter the SNS topic ARN you found earlier.
    7. Click **Add**. Your Lambda is now subscribed to the SNS topic.

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Using the AWS CLI</summary>

    - Enter the following AWS CLI command to subscribe your Lamdba function to the SNS topic:
        
        `aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <SNS_Topic_ARN> --notification-endpoint <YOUR_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN> --protocol lambda`
    - where:
        - `<SNS_TOPIC_ARN>` is replaced with the SNS topic ARN you found earlier.
        - `<YOUR_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN>` is replaced with the Lambda function ARN you found earlier.
    </details>

## Test the Lambda
To test that the Lambda function was deployed properly, you'll need to generate a malware detection using the [eicar test file](https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com "A file used for testing anti-malware scanners."), and then check the Quarantine bucket to make sure the `eicar` file was sent there successfully.

1. **Download the Eicar test file**
   - Temporarily disable your virus scanner or create an exception, otherwise it will catch the `eicar` file and delete it.
    - Browser: Go to the [eicar file](https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com) page and download `eicar_com.zip` or any of the other versions of this file.
    - CLI: curl -O https://secure.eicar.org/eicar_com.zip
2. **Upload the eicar file to the ScanningBucket**

    <details>
    <summary>Using the AWS console</summary>

    1. Go to **CloudFormation > Stacks** > your all-in-one stack > your nested storage stack.
    2. In the main pane, click the **Outputs** tab and then copy the **ScanningBucket** string. Search the string in Amazon S3 console to find your ScanningBucket.
    3. Click **Upload** and upload `eicar_com.zip`. File Storage Security scans the file and detects malware.
    4. Still in S3, go to your Quarantine bucket and make sure that `eicar.zip` file is present.
    5. Go back to your ScanningBucket and make sure the `eicar.zip` is no longer there.

    📌 It can take 30-60 seconds or more for the 'move' operation to complete, and during this time, you may see the file in both buckets.
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Using the AWS CLI</summary>

    - Enter the folowing AWS CLI command to upload the Eicar test file to the scanning bucket:

        `aws s3 cp eicar_com.zip s3://<YOUR_SCANNING_BUCKET> `
    - where:
        - `<YOUR_SCANNING_BUCKET>` is replaced with the ScanningBucket name.

    **NOTE:** It can take about 30-60 seconds or more for the file to move.

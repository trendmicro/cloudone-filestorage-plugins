## Deploy promote and quarantine function

1. Initialize terraform.

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

1. Deploy the function and fill the variables following the CLI. (Or using the `main.auto.tfvars` file)

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

    Instead of filling in the variables individually, you can create and use a `main.auto.tfvars` file. Enter the variables in to the `main.auto.tfvars.example` file, and then save the file as `main.auto.tfvars`. Once you have created and saved the file, you can reuse the file rather than fill in the variables every time.

## How can I contribute?

- Fork this repository.
- Commit your code with a message that is structured according to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
- Submit a PR with the information requested in PR template.
- You are very likely to be asked to squash you commits after PR review is done. There are several ways to do so.
  But if you don't know any, here is an example that squashes the latest 3 commits.

  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~3
  git commit -m "feat: Add some cool stuff"
  ```

  > Tip: Backup your branch before you try new things.

  > If you submit a PR on console and not familiar with git CLI, no big deal!
  > Just leave a comment in PR and we can do it for you!
